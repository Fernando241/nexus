# NEXUS

NEXUS is a Laravel backend designed to execute clear use cases,
with explicit separation between HTTP, domain, and support layers.

Principles:
- Thin controllers
- Explicit domain logic
- Replaceable infrastructure

This project serves as a senior-level engineering practice and
portfolio-grade backend foundation.
